# Idea in 50 words

"Mapin" revolutionizes the way we organize and explore places to visit. It's a social platform where users create, categorize, and share lists of must-see destinations. Integrating location-based services, social sharing, and real-time recommendations, Mapin makes discovering new experiences effortless and engaging, transforming travel planning into a community-driven adventure.

# Why make Mapin

Choosing Mapin as our venture was driven by a widespread problem that resonates personally with many, including myself: the cumbersome process of organizing, viewing, and sharing lists of must-visit places. Traditional methods, like the ubiquitous notes section or apps like Notion, are popular makeshift solutions. However, they fall short in two critical areas: organization and community engagement.

Mapin is not just another travel app; it's a comprehensive solution that marries the simplicity and speed of jotting down notes with the power of social connectivity. Imagine the scenario where you're exploring a new city, hunger strikes, and you recall a friend recommending a quaint little bistro nearby. With Mapin, accessing that recommendation is instantâ€”no more sifting through outdated notes or sending messages to get the latest update.

Consider my friend, a true food enthusiast, who meticulously curates a list of dining spots, complete with personal notes and hearsay on what to try. In the current scenario, staying updated requires a direct message and waiting for a response. Mapin transforms this experience. By simply following her list on our platform, you gain real-time access to her curated selections, enriched with personal insights and updates. This seamless integration of personal recommendations into your travel planning not only enhances your dining experiences but also strengthens community bonds.

Mapin's unique value proposition lies in its ability to transform the individual endeavor of travel planning into a shared journey, fostering a sense of community among users with similar interests. It's designed for the modern traveler, prioritizing speed, ease of use, and, most importantly, the joy of discovery through trusted networks.

In an era where social connections and personalized experiences are paramount, Mapin stands out as a beacon for adventurers seeking a more organized, social, and enriched travel experience. It's more than an app; it's a movement towards connected exploration, making every journey a shared adventure. This is why Mapin is not just a solution but a revolutionary step forward in how we explore the world around us.

# What makes you a good founder/CEO?

My journey as a Full-Stack Data Scientist and AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist has equipped me with a unique blend of skills that poise me for success as a Founder and CEO. My expertise in ML, AI and Programming in general are foundational to building innovative tech startups.

My tenure at an algorithmic & quantitative crypto hedge fund honed my abilities in applying machine learning, AWS Cloud technologies, statistical analysis, and database management to refine trading strategies and develop sophisticated risk models. This experience was instrumental in leading the creation of Quadra, a comprehensive Multi-Asset Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution platform, from its inception.

I have spent 2 years building out that start-up from the ground up. For all intents and purposes, I was acting as technical co-founder, but wasn't able to negotiate favourable equity for myself, so I decided to quit in December to focus on my own projects and entrepreneurship.

This leap of faith into entrepreneurship wasn't just a career shift; it was a commitment to applying my technical expertise and leadership skills to solve real-world problems.

As a founder, my technical prowess is complemented by a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the tech landscape. My experience in building Quadra demonstrates my capacity to lead complex projects from concept to execution. I've also seen the bumps in the road before, with Hiring, expanding the team, searching for funding etc.

In summary, my background as a data scientist, experience in developing cutting-edge technology platforms, and entrepreneurial drive make me uniquely qualified to lead as a Founder and CEO. With a proven track record of technical innovation and a commitment to solving complex problems, I believe i would make a good founder/CEO.
