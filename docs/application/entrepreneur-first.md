## What is the most impressive thing that you have achieved in the last 2 years?

> Building a startup is hard. We’re looking for people with a consistent track record of striving to achieve.

- 2 Years ago, i left my job to join a small startup
- I joined it as the only data scientist, specialized in AI, for a role in an algorithmic & quantitative crypto hedge fund
- The team was made up of a couple big-shot traders from NatWest Markets Plc.
- When FTX collapsed in early November 2022, our main backer pulled out, leaving us with just a 2-month runway. Still, I stuck around.
- Honestly, I Thrived on the adrenaline rush of pivoting - we turned our in-house OMS into a Multi-Asset Multi-Exchange crypto portfolio management platform. It was a massive pivot.
- I was 1 of 5 people in the company, the only one with proper programming knowledge, so it was up to me think about the infrastructure from the ground up, and code it out.
- This included learning an immense amount. I really cannot understate how much I've learnt. Everything from Real time streaming stacks deployed in AWS, deploying dockerised websocket servers on ECS with distributed cache for scaling with redis, solving issues about fan-out messages to clients, even building out the front-end was left to me. That is actually when I picked up Next.js as a framework. Eventually, I even leant Ray and deployed distributed python servers for computation tasks in EKS. It was all left entirely to me, I had 100% autonomy, and it was a great learning experience.
- After over a year of grinding on that, we had a platform that was actually being used by traders from 21Shares we had new Investors.
- Unfortunately, I was offered 0.2% equity, which was less than I'd been expecting and negotiating for. So I decided to leave in December 2023 to focus on my own projects and entrepreneurship, confident that If i could build that, I could build something for myself.
- Since then, I've been on a project spree, joining Hackathons, Networking etc. I'm ready to build something new.

Rapid growth! Nearly two years back, I left my stable job for an early startup that operated alongside an algorithmic Crypto hedge fund. The FTX collapse nearly sank us, but that's actually when I thrived; during a pivot, turning our in-house OMS into a Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution Platform. As the only programmer among traders, I created our infrastructure from scratch. A year of hustle paid off for a platform that attracted names like 21Shares. The whole process involved learning an immense amount. Unfortunately, I was offered little in equity, which is when I opted to embark on my own ventures to innovate on my own terms, confident that I could build something for myself with what I'd learnt.

## Provide an example of something you have done, built or created that demonstrates your unique skill or ability (something that most people could not, or would not have done)

> Choose an example from your professional or academic experience, or your work on a side project.

- My unique ability lies in specialising in AI
- I left University with a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering (MEng), but throughout, I'd been interested in AI, messing around with training GANs on my own to get my hands dirty with the tech (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shavvimalendiran_i-am-grateful-and-proud-to-have-graduated-activity-6842807497611374592-_TMG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
- I picked up my AWS AI and ML specialty cert (https://www.credly.com/badges/0180e2c6-8499-4b8d-b440-3867b3d0c763/linked_in_profile) whe I could foot the bill.
- Also, the first thing i did after quitting in Dec 2023 was get up to scratch with the tech behind the LLM and Generative AI wave that's become popular recently. I joined an AI Hackathon in december where I built out a Medical AI RAG app.
  - https://lablab.ai/event/gemini-ai-hackathon/shav/diagnosys-ai
  - Visit the link to watch the demo.
  - I built this because from discussions with mates, there is a real-world need because of diagnostic uncertainty in medicine, once a the history is taken, amongst F1's, F2's and IMT1's (junior doctors). Hospitals are short staffed as they are, and sometimes, even when things are busy, they need to run diagnoses by the registrar (who may not even be available) if there is any uncertainty. An AI could fit in here to validate diagnoses to save time.
- Now, after cold-calling people, I'm at a stage where I am consulting to one guy in India with a news site who wants a private and Local RAG app, because they don't want to surrender all their private data to OpenAI. I'm currently working on that with a guy I met off discord, mainly with the goal of becoming domain experts.
- I think these things, alongside my career with AI and ML in the hedge fund, demonstrates my unique skills and ability in the space.

My career with AI in the hedge fund and my certifications demonstrate my unique skills and ability in AI. But also, the first thing I did after quitting in December was to get up to speed with the GenAI wave. This involved building a Medical AI RAG app for a Hackathon addressing diagnostic uncertainty, a solution tailored for my junior doctor friends who were complaining about that exact problem. This project, viewable [here](https://lablab.ai/event/gemini-ai-hackathon/shav/diagnosys-ai), demonstrates my ability to learn quickly, and apply AI for real-world problems.

After cold-calling and interviewing people to investigate problems small businesses were facing, I'm now consulting on a private and local RAG application for a news site in India (https://www.petrowatch.com/) alongside someone I met off Discord.

## Give an example of a time you have persuaded someone senior to you or a time you have brought people together to work towards a common goal

> Choose an example from your professional or academic experience, or your work on a side project.

- Involved with Time Series Forecasting couple years ago
- Senioers were uninterested - saying things work the way they are working now, and that's fine.
- I went back, used their historical predictions, and porved that I would have out-performed them, and even outperfomed simpler models such as ARIMA
- i also knew that as a graduate, I didint ahve the weight to convince them, so I reached out to another senioir in the company who was interested in AI in general, and had the conversation with him
- With him convinced, and with his backing, I was able to go back to the seniors who were uninterested, and essentially storngarm them into letting me continue working on my model.

As a fresh Grad interested in implementing AI Demand Forecasting, I faced resistance from seniors. I'll never forget jumping on a call with a bunch of old men all content with the status quo - "If it works, why should we change it?". That mindset is one of my pet-peeves; I believe we should always be open to new ideas, especially when they are backed by data. So that's exactly what I did. I back-tested thoroughly and proved that I outperformed their historical predictions (and even traditional models like ARIMA). For weight in my appeal, I persuaded an AI-interested senior of my approach, and got him involved in the call that eventually got me the go-ahead to implement my model.

## How will this technology impact the world in the next 5 years?

> If you are a developer, what important developments do you anticipate in your domain in the next 5 years?

With the trend towards lower inference costs, faster processing, and larger context sizes, e.g. Groq, it's safe to assume that RAG would become obsolete, even though most AI apps today are based on this dominant architecture. RAG works for now to overcome limitations but I’d personally take full content in a prompt any day. Also the shortfalls of vector similarity are pretty obvious having worked with it.

In terms of access, GenAI will become a part of daily life. At the same time, the importance of trust, security, and the challenge of misinformation/abuse via generated content will increase (e.g. Taylor Swift on X). Also, the OpenAI-NYT lawsuit will be a good indicator of the direction regulation in AI will take.

## Are you currently working on your own startup or side-project? Please provide more information to help us understand the stage you’re at

> Do you have cofounders, a website, an MVP, or any users?

I have a scrappy website at https://mapin.co.uk/. I have an early WIP, am building the app out in Expo/React Native, have decided the database schema in PostgreSQL, deployed the back-end in Supabase, and have willing users in a waiting list.

## How can Entrepreneur First help you?

I want to meet similar minded people and collaborate on developing solutions to interesting problems together. Ultimately, I want to meet potential co-founders and build something revolutionary together.

## What random but surprisingly useful or interesting thing should we know about you?

Despite my fascination with GenAI, I used to sell my Graphic Design services during Uni. I have Speed Paints on my YouTube Channel: https://youtu.be/2audU-MHQ3Q, and the skills do come in handy!
