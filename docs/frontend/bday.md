At Mapin, we take the safety and privacy of our users very seriously. That's why we require all users to be at least 13 years old in order to create an account on our platform. This is not only a legal requirement, but also helps us to provide age-appropriate content and features to our users.

By providing your date of birth, we can tailor our services to your specific age group and interests. It also helps us to ensure that all users are old enough to use our platform and that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Rest assured that we will never share your personal information with third parties without your consent. Your privacy is our top priority, and we will do everything we can to keep your information secure while providing you with the best possible experience on Mapin.
