Mapin is the app i am making. To summarise, The problem is that people, including myself, struggle to organize, view and share lists of places they want to visit. If you’re in a location and happen to become hungry for example, how can you easily see the restaurants recommendations you’ve always wanted to go to that also happen to be nearby?
Mapin is a social media allows users to create lists of places they want to visit, categorize them (e.g. restaurants, museums, parks), and then view those lists based on their current location or search for specific places on the list. This would make it easy for users to quickly find and visit places they've been wanting to go to, without having to spend time searching for them each time they're in a new location.
The note section is the quickest, and what people use, but lacks 2 things: organization as well as community. Mapin provides both, while also prioritizing the speed and ease the notes section provides.
Mapin is the ultimate solution for organizing, sharing, and exploring places to visit. With Mapin, users can easily create categorized lists of places they want to visit, and access them instantly based on their current location or search for specific places on the list. Mapin provides a community-driven platform for discovering and sharing recommendations with like-minded travelers. Say goodbye to disorganized notes and hello to hassle-free travel planning with Mapin
In terms of Features, i want users to be able to Explore: search bar for specific locations/categories, rather than just browsing through a feed. On the Profile screen, UI want to include Includes user reviews & ratings of the places they've visited. This Adds a layer of social interaction and community engagement to the app, as well as providing valuable feedback for other users. Users will have lists and pins. We want to keep track of users lists, and the pins they have allocated to each list.
A single pin can be in multiple lists, Users can follow other lists, Pins can have comments from people, User can add notes to a Pin they add, Users can mark Pins as visited, at which point they can put up a review which will be visible on their profile
A pin can be bookmarked in addition to the option to add them to lists. This would allow users to easily save pins they're interested in without having to create a new list every time.
All locations will be mapped to locations from the Google API.
There will also be a ‘Create Variation’ feature. encourage user engagement and community buildin. users can replicate a pin they see in their feed and edit it how they want. The original pin will have a ‘variants’ counter, similar to likes, to see how many times the pin and its derivations were replicated.. The "derivations" counter could also be a useful metric for measuring the popularity and influence of a particular pin. This could help users discover new pins and lists that are trending or have a high level of engagement.
Google Maps/Yelp API to provide additional information and context for pins. Ratings & reviews for restaurant. How busy a park is in real-time.
Discover: Recommends lists or pins based on a user's location & interests. This could help users discover new places they might not have otherwise known about.
By default, all pins are private, unless they are put into a public list
Analytics features to track user behavior and engagement with the ap. User acquisition: Tracking the source of new users (e.g. social media, search engines, app stores, etc.) can help to identify which marketing channels are most effectiv. Feature usage: Knowing which features of the app are being used most frequently and which are being ignored can help to prioritize development efforts and improve the user experienc. User demographics: Collecting data on user demographics such as age, gender, location, and occupation can help to understand the app's user base and tailor the app's content and features to their needs.
Push notifications for different actions such as when someone follows their list or comments on a pin
Offline mode allows users to view and edit their pins and lists when they don't have an internet connection.
