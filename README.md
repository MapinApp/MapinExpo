## File Structure

```
config.ts     - Contains config
/context      - Contexts used to manage global state. Auth & Data
/lib          - Contains Functions, Hooks & Supabase Client
/components   - All Components. Most low level components, e.g. Text
/layout       - Layout components - higher level than components
/app          - Routing Folder. Each file becomes a route
  /(app)      - Logged in app
  /(auth)     - Auth Screens
```

## Screens
