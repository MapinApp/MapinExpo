## üöÄ ToDo

- [x] Have Map Component with Search

  - [ ] Remove the modal border
- [ ] Find a way to remove my Google Places API Key from the FrontEnd. Maybe use Serverless functions

  - [Good Blog](https://www.jsparling.com/using-hooks-and-context-with-sqlite-for-expo-in-react-native/)
- [ ] Implement Local DB fallback for when the user is offline / Supabase is unreachable
  - Is this necessary? Will need to think about [Syncing](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/357) when the user comes back online
